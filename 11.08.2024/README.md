Graphical Finite State Machine-Based Traffic Light Control Implementing Arduino and ESP32.
The implementation of a traffic light system using the Arduino platform and the ESP32-WROOM-32D controller is presented. 
The methodology for developing a control program based on graph theory through the creation of a finite state machine is demonstrated.
